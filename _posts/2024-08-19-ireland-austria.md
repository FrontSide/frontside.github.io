# Introduction

I was born and raised in Austria (Styria to be specific) and moved to Dublin, Ireland around my 22nd birthday, which I subsequently made my home.
In those 10 years I have often partaken in discussions that evolved around how life differs in the two countries (sometimes voluntarily, sometimes not so much).
Usually these discussions end with more questions than answers for me (not that everything always calls for an answer) and have me ponder about how things could be or could have been.
These thoughts are not usually productive and I believe a braindump is required to sort my head out. 
And that is what this is. 

This is not a travel blog or a tourist guide, it's not meant to pursuade anyone to change their opinion about either place (or anything in general). 
It's not a political opinion piece, though it'll be inevitable to talk about politics and personal believes to some extend.
Most importantly it's not a "country A is good, country B is bad, and that's a fact" rage piece.
What it is, is a digest of observations, processed and verified through research. A side-by-side of what I perceived (opinion) and how it actually is (facts).

## How to read
The target audience for this text is ... no-one. I am writing this for the purpose of writing, perhaps for myself to come back to it as a reference.
I'm not expecting anyone else to read this, certainly not the whole thing.
That being said, you might enjoy the read. 

I will be talking about a variety of different topics to varying degrees of detail. 
Reading it from top to bottom is unlikely going to be feasible, nor is it required. 
Instead, I would suggest a browse through the table of content and pick a topic you might be interested in.

## Disclaimer
I will be mixing fact and opinion. If it's a fact, I will do my very best to include a reference to source literature. If it's an opinion I will do my best to use appropriate language denoting it as such.

Naturally, not all my opinions will reflect every one else's so it may be useful to know where I'm "coming from". 
The first thing that is to be said upfront is that I live a fairly economically-privileged live. This is very important to know since one's economic situation will influence virtually all perceptiosn and everything one does.

My quality of life has - subjectively - improved after moving to Ireland. How? Why? I don't know, it just somehow did.
As a result, I tend to get quite defensive whenever people - especially those of similar backgrounds to mine - complain about the country extensively. 
It is almost a brotherly dynamic (*I may curse you, but I'll fight anyone else who dares to do the same*).

It's important to note that my migration has coincided with many other changes in my life and there are pleny of confounding factors - which I won't all go into - 
that make it impossible to gauge to which extend the move contributed to this perceived improvement in life quality.
Most notably, though, it coincided with me becoming - what I would consider to be - an adult (I was a late bloomer). I started doing things I wasn't doing before and stopped doing things I did before. 
I do therefore lack experience to make an objective comparison on many matters (though I doubt a believeable objective comparison could be made anyway, due to the many variables influencing our experiences).
